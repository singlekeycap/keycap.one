# keycap.one

_Why did I buy this domain?_

keycap.one is a all-in-one, mobile-ready, minimal-looking site which includes:
- My jailbroken iOS repo
- My "bio" site
- A Minecraft server
- And more(?)

As a wise developer once told me,

> Tailwind is a pain in the ass.
> It's making me want to bash my head in.

I could not agree more

... yet here I am working with Tailwind to bring to you this (hopefully) beautiful site.\
